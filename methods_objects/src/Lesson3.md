# Introduction to Objects and Classes

## What is a Class?
- A Class is a template, a logically organised listing of characteristics of something
- A master copy and everything is dependent on it
- A listing of logical characteristics that all the objects created have to be followed
- A Class defines the form of an object
- An Object is a specific instance of a class


## Example Class and Object
- Class Vehicle
  - Length
  - Passenger Capacity
  - Top Speed
  - Color
  
- Object Corvette
  - Length = 16ft
  - Passenger Capacity = 4
  - Top Speed = 205 mph
  - Color = red

### Classes define the <b> TEMPLATE </b>
### Objects are specific <b> INSTANCES </b> of the template

## Classes can also contain Methods
- Methods can also be members of the Class (template for an object)
- Class Methods operate on the Class Variables
- Classes should be organized with logical groupings of variables and methods


## Defining a Class
```java
Class className
{
    Declare Instance Variables
    Declare Method 1
    Declare Method 2, etc
}
```
